                    on Apple are on a collisioncourse.
                </li>    
                <li>Musk wants to vastly increase the amount of money the company makes <br>
                    through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech.”
                </li>
                <li>This creates a risk that Twitter could violate Apple or Google’s app rules <br> 
                    in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.
                </li>
                <li>Battle lines are being drawn. Last week, Musk complained about app store fees, <br> 
                    which are between 15% and 30% of digital sales, in a tweet.
