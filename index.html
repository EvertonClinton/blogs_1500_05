                <li>CNBC News reporter Kif Laswing reported on Nov 23 2022 that Twitter <br>
                    on Apple are on a collisioncourse.
                </li>    
                <li>Musk wants to vastly increase the amount of money the company makes <br>
                    through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech.”
                </li>
                <li>This creates a risk that Twitter could violate Apple or Google’s app rules <br> 
                    in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.
                </li>
                <li>Battle lines are being drawn. Last week, Musk complained about app store fees, <br> 
                    which are between 15% and 30% of digital sales, in a tweet.

                In its current form, Bill C-11 would require YouTube to manipulate these <br>
                systems, and surface content according to the CRTC’s priorities, rather <br>
                than the interests of Canadian users. Put into practice, this means that <br>
                when viewers come to the YouTube homepage, they’re served content that <br>
                a Canadian Government regulator has prioritized, rather than content <br>
                they are interested in.
