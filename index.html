                <li>CNBC News reporter Kif Laswing reported on Nov 23 2022 that Twitter <br>
                    on Apple are on a collisioncourse.
                </li>    
                <li>Musk wants to vastly increase the amount of money the company makes <br>
                    through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech.”
                </li>
                <li>This creates a risk that Twitter could violate Apple or Google’s app rules <br> 
                    in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.
                </li>
                <li>Battle lines are being drawn. Last week, Musk complained about app store fees, <br> 
                    which are between 15% and 30% of digital sales, in a tweet.

                In its current form, Bill C-11 would require <br>
                YouTube to manipulate these systems, and <br>
                surface content according to the CRTC’s <br>
                priorities, rather than the interests of<br> 
                Canadian users. Put into practice, this means <br>
                that when viewers come to the YouTube <br> 
                homepage, they’re served content that a <br>
                Canadian Government regulator has <br> 
                prioritized,rather than content they are <br>
                interested in.

            <h3>Microsoft could soon have its first union</h3>
                CNN News reporter Catherine Thorbecke <br>
                reported on Tue December 6, 2022  <br>
                11:31 AM EST, that 
            Some 300 quality assurance workers at <br>
            Microsoft-owned gaming studio ZeniMax <br>
            are in the process of voting to form <br>
            what would be the first union at the <br>
            tech giant, organizers confirmed to <br>
            CNN Business.
            
            The workers are organizing with the <br>
            Communications Workers of America <br>
            (CWA) union and have until the end <br>
            of December to vote on it. Microsoft <br>
            has agreed to recognize the union if <br>
            a majority of the workers vote in <br>
            favor of it, according to the CWA.
